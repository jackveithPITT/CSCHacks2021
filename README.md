# CSCHacks2021
## Project Description
- I want to create a web extension that emulates the Pokewalker minigame from the 4th generation main series Pokemon games Heartgold and Soulsilver.
- Technologies that will be required: Node.js web application to serve web resources, Firefox extensions (as well as potentially learning how to maek a cross browser extension), SQL or another database management language, OAuth sessions, and more tbd.
- I anticipate that it will be difficult to integrate the database retrieval into the web extension. This is something I have had issues with before, but for now it is the only issue that I know I will encounter; other than that many problems will most likely arise that I didn't consider because I am not well versed in the inner workings of the tech i will be using.
