# CSCHacks2021
THERE IS A LOT MORE INFO IN THE DEVLOG, SPECIFICALLY THE BEGINNING AND END. If you're at all interested, I advise you check it out :)

- I want to accomplish the creation of an in browser minigame through the use of an extension that mimics the Pokewalker minigame present in the gen IV pokemon titles Heartgold and Soulsilver.
- I want to do this because I enjoy the minigame (and in theory so do many others), I enjoy and have some experience with the technologies I need to use to make this project, and CSC Hacks has given me an excuse/deadline to make this project that I've been sitting on for a while into something tangible.
- There are a lot of technologies that I will have to learn about, some that I do not even know I will need to learn yet, but right now some things that I am looking at are:
  - Firefox extension scripting (mostly raw Javascript)
  - Serverside web application backed by database (Node.js, Express, MySQL)
  - login and authentication, along with security and best practices
  - Internet data transfer technologies (websockets, HTTP headers, CORS, etc.)
  - dynamic HTML displays
- I have already run into many issues regarding getting extensions connected to servers, and I predict that it might still cause me trouble as there are a lot of things that you have to do to ensure a healthy connection between client and server. I predict that I will also run into some issues getting the display of the game working as intended, at least most notably. In my experience projects tend to bep lagued by a variety of small and unforeseeable issues, so it is hard to say what will bug me the most (ahaha)
